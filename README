yaGTD - Yet Another Getting Things Done
=======================================

**yaGTD** project is a very simple utility designed to make the
management of your to-do list quick and easy.

I have several long-term projects at work, and I need reminders
to spend time on the important things that aren't too urgent.
When, in 2006, I read David Allen's personal-productivity book
`Getting Things Done`_, I tried to apply this method on my personal
projects;  So, I needed a 'trusted system' ...

.. _Getting Things Done: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTD

But what another to-do list?  There are hundreds of to-do lists on the
web, some commercial, some free, some need on-line connection while
other not, some are integrated into an email client and some web sites
were built to manage your to-do list, but I was looking for something
a little different.

.. _GTDTiddlyWiki: http://shared.snapgrid.com/gtd_tiddlywiki.html

What I wanted was something lightweight and flexible, a simple way to
carry and maintain my tasks around on a USB stick.
The program needed to be capable of running on different platforms and
must not depend on any data format or any web connection.

I tried several software for managing to-do lists, including the excellent
iKog_ and pyGTD_ [#]_ programs, but I found that the former was missing the
notion of urgency and importance (preached by Stephen Covey into
`Seven Habits of Highly Effective People`_), and the latter made it
too laborious to maintain data.

.. [#] pyGTD is now part of VimGTD_ (original ^^).

.. _Seven Habits of Highly Effective People: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671708635/areadersjournal

And so, after several months of occasional experimentation, I decided
to write my own tool that includes the easy to use but powerful
commmand line interface from iKog_ and the management of Covey
concepts from pyGTD_.

To resume, if you are looking for fancy menus and windows, go away;
But, if you are comfortable at the command line a simple plain text is
an age-old but perfect method for tracking your stuff, and *yaGTD* can
help you to manage efficiently this file.
